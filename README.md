The (fictional) Cyclops Hospital Network (CHN) has 31 locations where pediatric patients who potentially have viral or bacterial pneumonia may seek diagnosis and care. Given certain symptoms and the severity of those symptoms, many of those patients will undergo X-ray imaging of the chest.
Given that a CHN radiologist has a maximum of 12 hours to review these images and the initial assessment of the imaging
is done by either an emergency room physician or an urgent care practitioner, who may be less accurate in diagnosing
pneumonia via imaging, CHN wishes to create a decision support tool (DST) using a neural network in order to check the
assessment of the emergency room and urgent care physicians.

## [US Vaccination Predictions](https://github.com/austint1121/Flatiron_GOATS_Vaccination_Prediction)

The fictional mayor of the fictional city, Goat city, TN, is ordering Covid vaccines, and is fully aware that not
everyone will choose to get vaccinated. Goat city wants to know how many Covid vaccines they should be ordering. They
hired my team, the Flatiron GOATS, to assist them with this task.

## [King's County Housing Project](https://github.com/Jyve00/King_County_Housing)

The city of Seattle is looking to improve low property value neighborhoods. They want to know which neighborhoods would
benefit the most from the grants, and what the grants should be used for. We used a dataset of individual houses
from King County in Washington state. Using this data, we used linear regression modeling to make recommendations to
the city of seattle on which features of a home will increase the property value the most.

## [Venus Analytic's Movie Analysis](https://github.com/austint1121/VenusMovieAnalysis)

The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights to the head of Microsoft's new fictional movie studio.
We used data from Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, and The Numbers. After analyzing the data the
group decided to recommend a genre of movie to make, which month to release the movie in, and how long the movie should be.
