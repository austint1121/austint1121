## Projects


### [US Vaccination Predictions](https://github.com/austint1121/Flatiron_GOATS_Vaccination_Prediction)
The fictional mayor of the fictional city, Goat city, TN, is ordering Covid vaccines, and is fully aware that not
everyone will choose to get vaccinated. Goat city wants to know how many Covid vaccines they should be ordering. They
hired my team, the Flatiron GOATS, to assist them with this task.

### [King's County Housing Project](https://github.com/Jyve00/King_County_Housing)
The city of Seattle is looking to improve low property value neighborhoods. They want to know which neighborhoods would
benefit the most from the grants, and what the grants should be used for. We used a dataset of individual houses
from King County in Washington state. Using this data, we used linear regression modeling to make recommendations to
the city of seattle on which features of a home will increase the property value the most.

### [Venus Analytic's Movie Analysis](https://github.com/austint1121/VenusMovieAnalysis)
The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights to the head of Microsoft's new fictional movie studio.
We used data from Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, and The Numbers. After analyzing the data the
group decided to recommend a genre of movie to make, which month to release the movie in, and how long the movie should be.
